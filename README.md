Our research for this project was mainly about how artificial intelligence generally works, as is represented through our introductory slides. Furthermore, we focused on some of the primary issues concerning how AI should be used.
For instance, our first policy was primarily about the application of copyright to AI generated content, while the third policy was focused on some of the biases that AI often has through its training process.
